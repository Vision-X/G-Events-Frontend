## Display Events
1. I am a Galvanize event attendee, and I need to be able to retrieve information about upcoming events, so I can make plans to attend.

2. Acceptance criteria: As an event attendee, when I open the application, I want to click on the Events button and have upcoming events listed chronologically, with information on location, including address, floor, and room name.

## Display Maps
1. I am a Galvanize event attendee, and I should be able to retrieve floor maps, so I can find my own way to the room corresponding to the event I plan to attend.

2. Acceptance criteria: As an event attendee, when I am viewing the list of events, I want to be able to click on a link that will take me to a map of the floor and room where the event is being held. I want the map to render in a practical view depending on the the device I am using.

## Update Events
1. I am an event administrator, and I need to be able to add and update events through a form, so information provided to users is accurate.

2. Acceptance criteria: As an administrator, I want to be able to navigate to a form page where I can enter new event data that will be added to the events database and render on the events list. I also want to be able to update data for a particular event using the form.

## Prioritization
1. Display Events. We have to be able to retrieve existing data from an events database before we can update or add to it.

2. Display Maps. We must provide complete navigation information to each event to ensure the value we provide to our users.

3. Update Events. Our app form should allow events to be updated and added so our events list stays accurate and relevant.
